# Configs
This directory stores configs that I would like to sync between my machines, but aren't large enough to warrant their own repository. I could've just made a repository just for those configs, but instead included them here.
## Alacritty
This is the config I use for Alacritty (the best terminal emulator ever in existence). I copied most of it from [DistroTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVls1GmFKf6WlTraIb_IaJg), I did change the font and the theme though.
## Starship
This is the config I use for Starship (the best command line prompt ever in existence). This is basically the default one in [Garuda Linux](https://garudalinux.org).
