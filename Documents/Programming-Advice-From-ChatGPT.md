#### Is it smart to learn C and then Rust? I want to know systems languages (especially Rust) but I'm not sure how to start. I'm thinking that learning the two in that order is sensible.
Learning C and then Rust can be a sensible approach if you want to delve into systems programming languages. C is a widely-used and foundational language for systems programming, and learning it provides a solid understanding of low-level concepts, memory management, and manual control over hardware resources. Many existing systems and libraries are written in C, so having a good grasp of C can be beneficial.

Once you are comfortable with C, transitioning to Rust can be a logical next step. Rust is a modern systems programming language that offers memory safety, strong static typing, and high-level abstractions while maintaining performance and control over system resources. Rust's focus on safety and its modern features make it an appealing language for systems programming, particularly when it comes to writing secure and reliable code.

By learning C first, you will gain valuable insights into systems programming concepts and practices. This knowledge will provide a solid foundation upon which you can build your understanding of Rust. Moreover, transitioning from C to Rust will help you appreciate the benefits and advantages that Rust brings to the table, such as memory safety without sacrificing performance.

Remember that learning any programming language requires practice and hands-on experience. As you progress through your learning journey, make sure to work on projects and exercises that allow you to apply the concepts and techniques you learn in both C and Rust. Practical experience will solidify your understanding and help you develop proficiency in these languages.
#### If my end goal is to learn Rust, then would learning C++ be redundant? I'm thinking so but I'm welcome to contradictory opinions.
If your end goal is to learn Rust, learning C++ may not be redundant, but it may not be essential either. While there are some similarities between C++ and Rust, they are distinct languages with different philosophies and design principles.

Learning C++ can provide you with a broader understanding of systems programming and object-oriented programming concepts. It is a widely-used language with a vast ecosystem and is still prevalent in many industries. C++ also offers low-level control, performance, and compatibility with existing C codebases. So, if you have specific use cases or projects that involve C++ or require interoperability with existing C++ code, learning C++ can be beneficial.

However, if your primary focus is on Rust and its unique features, such as memory safety, ownership, and concurrency model, you can directly dive into Rust without learning C++. Rust is designed to address many of the challenges and pitfalls present in languages like C and C++, while providing high-level abstractions and modern programming constructs. It has its own syntax, concepts, and idioms that are distinct from C++.

Ultimately, the decision to learn C++ as a stepping stone to Rust depends on your specific goals, interests, and the projects you want to pursue. If you feel C++ aligns with your objectives and will provide you with additional knowledge and opportunities, it can be worth considering. However, if your primary focus is on Rust and its unique features, you can start learning Rust directly without feeling that learning C++ is a mandatory prerequisite.
#### If I want to write code that maximises freedom, should I sometimes care more about programmers freedom (making the program clearer at the cost of performance sometimes and focusing on making the codebase easy to refactor and understand) or focus on the user's freedom? I prefer the first option more as everyone who will use my code will probably be a programmer (and it gives me more freedom) but at the same time I think the end user is more important whether or not they they even understand or look at the code.
Balancing the priorities of programmer freedom and end user freedom can be a subjective decision, and it often depends on the specific context, project goals, and target audience. However, I'll provide some perspectives that can help you navigate this trade-off.

1. Programmer Freedom: Prioritizing programmer freedom involves making the codebase clearer, easier to refactor, and understand. This approach focuses on empowering developers to efficiently work with the code, maintain it, and introduce new features. It can lead to improved productivity, code quality, and long-term maintainability.

2. End User Freedom: Prioritizing end user freedom revolves around delivering a product or solution that provides the best possible experience for the end user. This includes considerations like performance, responsiveness, usability, and meeting the specific needs of the users. The emphasis here is on creating software that is reliable, efficient, and serves the users' requirements effectively.

While both aspects are important, it's worth considering the following:

- User Perspective: If your end users are primarily programmers who will interact with or extend your code, then prioritizing programmer freedom aligns well with their needs. However, if your users are non-technical individuals who will only interact with the end product, then focusing on their freedom, experience, and usability becomes more critical.

- Context and Constraints: Consider the project's specific requirements, constraints, and trade-offs. Certain domains or applications may demand a higher emphasis on performance, efficiency, or usability, while others may prioritize maintainability and extensibility. Assess the goals, expectations, and constraints of your project to find the appropriate balance.

- Iterative Approach: It's often beneficial to adopt an iterative development process. Start by prioritizing programmer freedom during the initial stages to establish a solid foundation. As the project progresses, gather feedback from users and consider incorporating their needs and preferences. This allows you to strike a balance between programmer and user freedom over time.

In summary, finding the right balance between programmer freedom and end user freedom depends on factors such as the project's goals, target audience, and specific context. Prioritizing programmer freedom can be appropriate when your users are predominantly programmers, while prioritizing end user freedom is crucial when catering to non-technical users. Ultimately, considering both perspectives and adopting an iterative approach can help you achieve a well-rounded and user-centric solution.
#### What if I'm the only person writing the code? I want to make the code readable for other programmers but at the same time sometimes feel it is a bit redundant.
If you are the sole developer working on the codebase, the importance of making the code readable for other programmers may seem less critical at first. However, there are still benefits to prioritizing code readability, even in a solo development environment. Here's why:

1. Future Maintenance: Even if you are the only one currently working on the code, there may come a time when someone else needs to understand or modify it. It could be a new team member, a collaborator, or even your future self. By writing readable code, you make it easier for others (including yourself) to navigate, understand, and modify the codebase, which reduces the time and effort required for maintenance and future updates.

2. Debugging and Troubleshooting: Readable code can significantly aid in debugging and troubleshooting. Clear and well-structured code makes it easier to identify and locate issues, enabling you to diagnose and fix problems more efficiently. It can save you valuable time and frustration, even when you're the only one involved in the development process.

3. Knowledge Transfer: Suppose you want to share your code with others, contribute to open-source projects, or collaborate with other developers in the future. In that case, readable code becomes crucial for effective knowledge transfer. It allows others to understand your code quickly, encourages collaboration, and facilitates the exchange of ideas and improvements.

4. Personal Efficiency: Even as a solo developer, writing readable code can enhance your personal productivity. Clear code is easier to navigate, understand, and reason about, enabling you to work faster and more accurately. It improves your ability to iterate on the codebase, experiment, and introduce new features or changes.

While it may sometimes feel redundant to focus on code readability when you're the only developer, it is a valuable practice that can bring long-term benefits. Consistently prioritizing readability fosters good coding habits and discipline, which can have a positive impact on your development process and future endeavors.
#### Would it be reasonable to include a documentation file written in markdown for every file of code I have? Sometimes the README.md doesn't feel like the right place to put the documentation.
Including a documentation file written in Markdown for each code file can be a reasonable approach, especially if you feel that the README.md file is not suitable for specific documentation needs. Breaking down the documentation into smaller, more focused files can make it easier to maintain and navigate, particularly when the codebase becomes larger and more complex.

Here are some benefits of having per-file documentation:

1. Enhanced Organization: By having dedicated documentation files for each code file, you can maintain a more organized structure within your project. It allows developers to locate and access relevant documentation quickly, without needing to search through a single large README.md file.

2. Contextual Information: Documentation that is directly linked to specific code files provides contextual information within the immediate context. This can be particularly useful when there are intricate relationships or complex algorithms within a file. Developers can quickly refer to the associated documentation to gain a deeper understanding of the code's purpose, logic, and usage.

3. Maintainability: Having documentation directly linked to code files can improve maintainability. When you make changes to a specific code file, you can update the accompanying documentation in the same location, ensuring that they remain synchronized. This practice can help prevent inconsistencies or outdated information that may arise if documentation is scattered or disconnected from the code.

4. Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing: Dedicated per-file documentation files facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing. When working in a team or sharing your code with others, having comprehensive and well-structured documentation at the file level allows team members to understand the code's purpose, behavior, and usage more effectively. It can also help onboard new team members or contributors more efficiently.

While including per-file documentation files can be beneficial, it's important to strike a balance. Avoid over-documenting or duplicating information unnecessarily. Ensure that the documentation remains up to date and aligned with the code changes to avoid confusion or misleading information.

Consider documenting code files that are complex, have specific usage patterns, or require detailed explanations. For simpler code files, concise comments within the code itself may suffice. The goal is to provide sufficient documentation to aid understanding and maintainability without overwhelming developers with excessive documentation.

Ultimately, the documentation approach should align with your project's needs and the expectations of other developers who may work on or collaborate with your codebase.
#### How long does it take a programmer to learn C. I know Python and BASH, as well as programming concepts, but I am unsure how long I should estimate learning C will take.
The time it takes to learn C can vary depending on several factors, including your prior programming experience, the time you can dedicate to learning, your learning style, and the depth of knowledge you aim to achieve. However, I can provide a general estimate based on common experiences.

Given your background in Python and BASH, you already have a solid foundation in programming concepts, which will help you grasp C more quickly. C is a low-level language with its own syntax and programming paradigms, so there will still be new concepts to learn and adapt to.

On average, with consistent effort and focused learning, it may take several weeks to a few months to become reasonably proficient in C. This timeframe allows for gaining familiarity with the language syntax, understanding data types, memory management, pointers, basic I/O operations, control flow structures, and common C libraries.

To expedite your learning process, consider the following tips:

1. Learning Resources: Choose high-quality learning resources, such as textbooks, online tutorials, video courses, or interactive coding platforms, that provide clear explanations and practical exercises. Some recommended resources for learning C include "The C Programming Language" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie (often referred to as the "K&R" book), online tutorials like "Learn C" from learn-c.org, and interactive platforms like HackerRank or Exercism.

2. Practice Coding: Actively engage in coding exercises and projects to reinforce your understanding of C concepts. Write small programs, work on coding challenges, and gradually increase the complexity of your projects. Practical experience will solidify your knowledge and help you become comfortable with the language.

3. Read Code Examples: Study and analyze well-written C code examples. Explore open-source projects written in C to gain exposure to real-world scenarios and best practices. Reading and understanding existing code can provide insights into common patterns, idioms, and effective coding techniques.

4. Seek Help and Collaboration: Join online forums, developer communities, or C-specific forums to seek help, clarify doubts, and learn from experienced programmers. Engaging in discussions and collaborating with others can accelerate your learning process.

Remember that becoming proficient in any programming language, including C, is an ongoing journey. It's essential to continually practice, expand your knowledge, and work on real-world projects to deepen your understanding and become a proficient C programmer.
